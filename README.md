# NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool. Tableau is great for helping us tell a story by providing us with the tools to create analytic dashboards. Creating clear and easy to read visualizations is helpful for stakeholders when making decisions. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project is to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. We will be creating visualizations based on data from a New York Citibike dataset. This information will be used to see if a bike-sharing company could be a good business investment in Des Moines. Using Tableau, we will be creating visualizations that show:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
